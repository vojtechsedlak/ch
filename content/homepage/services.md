Having navigated parenting young children and adult children, I can deeply relate to a parentâ€™s desire to create an emotionally healthy environment and healthy, loving relationships for and with their children.  I have great empathy for parents who feel they are not meeting those goals due to overwhelming personal issues, unhealed childhood wounds, unforeseen circumstances and child behavioural challenges they were not anticipating.   

I help parents look at the unhealed parts of themselves that may be making it difficult for them to bring themselves to their children in the most helpful and grown up way.  Sometimes we parents need to grow up the child within us before we can help our children grow up.  Challenging behaviours can be perplexing and even those parents who are well equipped emotionally just simply need to hear about other ways to approach problem behaviour.
