Having navigated parenting young children and adult children, **I can deeply relate to a parent’s desire to create an emotionally healthy environment and healthy, loving relationships for and with their children.**  I have great empathy for parents who feel they are not meeting those goals due to overwhelming personal issues, unhealed childhood wounds, unforeseen circumstances and child behavioural challenges they were not anticipating.   

I help parents look at the unhealed parts of themselves that may be making it difficult for them to bring themselves to their children in the most helpful and grown up way.  Sometimes we parents need to grow up the child within us before we can help our children grow up. **If we want our children to have healthy core beliefs then we have to examine our own core beliefs and be open to recognizing the unhealthy ones we hold that impact how we relate to our children.** Unconscious patterns of response can sabotage the healthy, loving relationship we want to have with our child. **If our children see us continuing to grow and evolve they will be more open to doing so themselves.**

Challenging behaviours can be perplexing and even those parents who are well equipped emotionally just simply need to hear about other ways to approach problem behaviour.  Every age can challenge us as parents to find healthy ways of dealing with such things as oppositional behaviour, social anxiety, sibling rivalry and academic challenges to name a few. 

- The art of distraction as I refer to it can be so useful in derailing tantrums in toddlers. 
- The use of puppets for simple conversations with young ones can sometimes be more effective than mom or dad trying to impart a teaching. 
- Teaching young children to identify feelings can give them language for communicating to help parents better understand their child’s state. 
- Giving children tools for regulation can help children relax and then with parental help look for solutions to their problems. 
- Teaching children simple concepts about their mind, beliefs and thoughts can gradually empower them with the understanding that they are not just passive containers but active participants in the thoughts and beliefs they hold of themselves. 
- Helping children uncover unhealthy beliefs they hold of themselves and exploring patterns of negative thinking can start to unravel some of the anxiety and oppositional behaviour that children exhibit. 

There are also many books that parents can access that can help them have these important conversations with their children.
