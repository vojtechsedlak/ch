##### Professional Experience

My passion for supporting parents began shortly after completing my degree in Special Education.  My career path changed course early on as my dreams of becoming a teacher faded upon hearing I was ineligible for a Canadian teaching certificate after completing my 4 year degree at an American university.  I embarked upon a career path with government services that led to work supporting both parents and caregivers of children and adults with developmental disabilities.  My work in child development and behavioural counselling brought me together with parents faced with fear, uncertainty and a parenting experience that did not match their dreams and expectations.  My work as a Vocational Rehab counsellor again connected me with parents who wanted their children to be a part of the world of work and the independence and fulfillment that could be realized for them through it.

Further post degree work in Marriage and Family therapy and counselling led me to a position as a social worker with Family Services.  I fulfilled many roles involving things like parent/school mediation, resource acquisition, couples and individual counselling and emergency after hours services that involved mental health and child protection.  I have experience managing group homes and coordinating home share placements, jobs that again brought me together with parents who wanted good experiences for their children.

Upon retirement,  I found myself wishing to spend more time with children so over the past 5 years I worked as a casual education assistant in Saanich School District #63. This gave me more insight into children and the education experience. Due to Covid and the arrival of a new grandson, I left my work with the school division.

As a parent of 2 adult children, I am so grateful for the experience of being a parent.  I knew from the beginning of my relationship with my first child that it was going to be a life altering experience if I allowed it to be.  It has been and continues to be one of the most transformative experiences of my life.  I had lots to learn about myself and parenting created daily opportunities for understanding and healing.
