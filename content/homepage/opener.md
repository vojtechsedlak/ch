As a parent consultant, I offer support to parents who are struggling to address the many challenges that raising children can bring. I am about encouraging parents to embrace the personal transformation that is possible through becoming a conscious parent.  A conscious parent is one who is aware of how their interpretation of their personal story impacts how they bring themselves to life and relationships, particularly the relationships they have with their children.
