I offer parents a free 15 minute consult to give them a sense of whether working with me feels like a good fit.  My rate per hour is $75.00. I am open to discussing a reduced fee if finances just cannot accommodate this expense.


#### Scheduling
You can reach out to me for an appointment at PeacefulParents.ca. During these Covid times, I will be offering online sessions only.

#### Inclusivity
I warmly welcome parents of all genders, sexual orientation and cultural backgrounds.
