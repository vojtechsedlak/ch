                    <p>As a parent consultant, I offer support to parents who are struggling to address the many challenges that come with raising children. I am about encouraging parents to embrace the personal transformation that is possible through becoming a conscious parent.  A conscious parent is one who is aware of how their interpretation of their personal story impacts how they bring themselves to life and relationships, particularly the relationships they have with their children.</p>

<h5 id="professional-experience">Professional Experience</h5>
<p>My passion for supporting parents began shortly after completing my degree in Special Education. My intended career path as a teacher changed course early on and shifted to work with government services. Most of my career has been spent supporting both parents and caregivers of children and adults with disabilities.</p>
<p>My work in child development and behavioural counselling brought me together with parents faced with fear, uncertainty and a parenting experience that did not match their dreams and expectations. My work as a Vocational Rehabilitation counsellor again connected me with parents who wanted their children to be a part of the world of work and experience the independence and fulfillment that could be realized for them through it.</p>
<p>Further post degree work in Marriage and Family therapy and counselling led me to a position as a social worker with Family Services. I fulfilled many roles involving things such as parent/school mediation, resource acquisition, couples and individual counselling and emergency after hours services that primarily addressed mental health issues and child protection. I have experience managing group homes and coordinating home share placements, jobs that again brought me together with parents who wanted good experiences for their children.</p>
<p>Upon retirement,  I found myself wishing to spend more time with children so over the past 5 years I worked as a casual education assistant in Saanich School District #63. This gave me more insight into children and the education experience. Due to Covid and the arrival of my sixth grandchild, I left my work with the school division.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to be a mother to two now adult children. I knew from the beginning of my relationship with my first child that it was going to be a life altering experience if I allowed it to be.  It has been and continues to be one of the most transformative experiences of my life.  I had lots to learn about myself and parenting created daily opportunities for understanding and healing.</p>

                    <p>Having navigated parenting young children and adult children, <strong>I can deeply relate to a parent’s desire to create an emotionally healthy environment and healthy, loving relationships for and with their children.</strong>  I have great empathy for parents who feel they are not meeting those goals due to overwhelming personal issues, unhealed childhood wounds, unforeseen circumstances and child behavioural challenges they were not anticipating.</p>
<p>I help parents look at the unhealed parts of themselves that may be making it difficult for them to bring themselves to their children in the most helpful and grown up way.  Sometimes we parents need to grow up the child within us before we can help our children grow up. <strong>If we want our children to have healthy core beliefs then we have to examine our own core beliefs and be open to recognizing the unhealthy ones we hold that impact how we relate to our children.</strong> Unconscious patterns of response can sabotage the healthy, loving relationship we want to have with our child. <strong>If our children see us continuing to grow and evolve they will be more open to doing so themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Challenging behaviours can be perplexing and even those parents who are well equipped emotionally just simply need to hear about other ways to approach problem behaviour.  Every age can challenge us as parents to find healthy ways of dealing with such things as oppositional behaviour, social anxiety, sibling rivalry and academic challenges to name a few.</p>
<ul>
<li>The art of distraction as I refer to it can be so useful in derailing tantrums in toddlers.</li>
<li>The use of puppets for simple conversations with young ones can sometimes be more effective than mom or dad trying to impart a teaching.</li>
<li>Teaching young children to identify feelings can give them language for communicating to help parents better understand their child’s state.</li>
<li>Giving children tools for regulation can help children relax and then with parental help look for solutions to their problems.</li>
<li>Teaching children simple concepts about their mind, beliefs and thoughts can gradually empower them with the understanding that they are not just passive containers but active participants in the thoughts and beliefs they hold of themselves.</li>
<li>Helping children uncover unhealthy beliefs they hold of themselves and exploring patterns of negative thinking can start to unravel some of the anxiety and oppositional behaviour that children exhibit.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also many books that parents can access that can help them have these important conversations with their children.</p>
